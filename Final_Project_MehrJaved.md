## Project Outline 

### Project Summary: 
The reported cases of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in the US reached an all time high in 2017. This project will depict the growth of STD prevalence graphically, before providing preventative measures individuals can engage in to tackle this growth. 

#### Story Arc: 

1. Section 1: Describing rising STD rates of STD prevalence in the United States 
2. Section 2: Background explaining what STDs are, and why they are a concern
3. Section 3: Exploring potential reasons for this rise in STD prevalence 
4. Section 4: Existing policies to combat growth in STD prevalence 
5. Section 5: Alternative solutions to prevent the spread of STDs

### The Data 

The primary source of data for this project will be the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2017 report on Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance. It is publically accessible at this link: https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/2017-STD-Surveillance-Report_CDC-clearance-9.10.18.pdf   

Tables from this report will be scraped using Tabula to extract data in a csv format. Then, this data will be used to plot trends in STD growth over the years, and determine which STDs are most prevalent. Additional data sources may be explored if necessary. 

### Method
