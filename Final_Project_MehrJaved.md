## Final Project Part 1: Project Outline 

### Project Summary: 
The reported cases of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in the US reached an all time high in 2017. This project will depict the growth of STD prevalence graphically, before providing preventative measures individuals can engage in to tackle this growth. 

#### Story Arc: 

1. Section 1: Describing the rising rates of STD prevalence in the United States 
2. Section 2: Background explaining what STDs are, and why they are a concern
3. Section 3: Exploring potential reasons for this rise in STD prevalence 
4. Section 4: Existing policies to combat growth in STD prevalence 
5. Section 5: Alternative solutions to prevent the spread of STDs

### The Data 

The primary source of data for this project will be the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2017 report on Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance. It is publically accessible at this link: https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/2017-STD-Surveillance-Report_CDC-clearance-9.10.18.pdf   

This data will be used to plot trends in STD growth over the years. Additional data sources may be explored if necessary. 

### Method and Medium

Since the report above is in pdf format, relavent tables from this report will be scraped using Tabula to extract data in a csv format. These tables are available in the report page 68 onwards.  

Once the data has been scraped, the data will be cleaned to plot the following: 
+ Time series graphs of STD growth of the years 
+ Populations most at risk of STDS, by age, sex, and ethnicity
+ States with the highest STDs prevalence rate  

Text accompanying these charts will be gathered from online news articles and the CDC report. The final data story will be created in Shorthand.
