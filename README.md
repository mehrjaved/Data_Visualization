# About Me

Hi! My name is Mehr Javed. I'm a second year Master's in Public Policy and Management student from Lahore, Pakistan. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, I graduated with a degree in Economics and Politics. My primary research interests lie in policy analysis and program evaluation. I came to Carnegie Mellon with the intent of expanding my understanding in two domains: (1) Human behaviour and what motivates individuals to make the decisions they do and (2) How quantitative tools and analysis can be used to design and improve policy design and implementation.  
Over the summer, I was interning with the City of Pittsburgh, in the Division of Sustainability and Resilience, as a Food Policy Intern. This was actually my first experience in understanding first hand how useful data visualization can be in communicating information to government officials. Over the course of the internship, I developed visualizations to highlight food deserts in the city of Pittsburgh, and where the highest proportions of food insecure individuals are geographically spread out over the city. 

# What I Hope to Learn

By taking this course, I hope to fulfil two goals:   
+ Understanding the key elements of a good visualization
+ Becoming proficient at creating clear and purposeful visual charts that are appropriate for the data, context, and intended audience.

# My Porfolio

Here's where all my visualizations will go!
